### What I learned

I learned how to use sass @mixin and fetch data from API in JavaScript.

```sass
@mixin display($display, $justify, $align)
    display: flex
    justify-content: $justify
    align-items: $align
```

```js
const fetchWeather = async (city) => {
    let date = new Date();
    const APIkey = '86f60f58f0e04aabf2a4d950d3b57933';
    const url = "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?units=metric&q=";
    const res = await fetch(url + city + `&appid=${APIkey}`)
    const data = await res.json();
};
```


### Useful resources

- [Sass Docs](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/) - This helped me to learn Sass. I really liked its documentation and will use it going forward.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval) - This is an amazing website which helped me finally understand eval(). I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
